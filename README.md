# Multiclass Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying **garment worker productivity** using **Multiclass Logistic Regression** and **Multiclass Decision Forest**. The objective is to predict productivity levels based on various workplace factors.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Training**: Implementing **Multiclass Logistic Regression** and **Multiclass Decision Forest**.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Azure ML Integration**: Comparison of model performance in **Python vs Azure ML Studio**.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Open `task1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to **load data, preprocess, train models, and evaluate performance**.
3. Compare results between **Python implementation** and **Azure ML Studio models**.

## Results

- The best-performing model is identified based on **classification accuracy and interpretability**.
- Insights are drawn to improve **worker productivity prediction** for real-world applications.

## References

- Dataset: **Garment Worker Productivity Dataset** (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- Azure ML Studio for **automated ML model comparison**.
